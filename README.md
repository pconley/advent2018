Advent of Code Puzzles 2018

## Status

In the early puzzles I was not carefully keeping the working code as I had no plans.

Later puzzles are preserved and working... about 10+

Totally stuck on 17.  My solution is fast and runs to completion.  A visual inspection
seems to handle all the situations as I expect... but the AoC site says my andwer is wrong.
